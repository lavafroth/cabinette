I also recommend taking a knob or so of room temperature butter and add it in and stirring it, melting it into the pasta.
Ideally leave the pasta slightly undercooked, because it will go in the hot sauce and finish cooking there.
Ideally this should be a wide skillet with tall sides, but a pot will also do the job.
Ideally your pork covers the entire surface of the small pan---crowding is good for this recipe.

If satisfied, repeat step 9. (Most cutlet sizes work well.
